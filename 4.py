Definition: API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

Use Cases of API:

Integration: APIs enable different software systems to work together. For example, a weather application can use an API to get real-time weather data from a third-party service.
Data Retrieval: APIs are commonly used to retrieve data from a server or a database. For instance, a mobile app might use an API to fetch user information from a server.
Functionality Extension: APIs allow developers to extend the functionality of existing applications. For example, developers can use social media APIs to integrate social sharing features into their apps.


Limitations of API:

Rate Limits: Many APIs impose rate limits to prevent abuse. Exceeding these limits may result in temporary or permanent restrictions.
Dependency: If a third-party API service goes down or changes its structure, it can impact the functionality of the applications relying on it.
Security Concerns: Improperly secured APIs may be vulnerable to attacks such as injection or unauthorized access.
Data Format Compatibility: Differences in data formats between APIs can complicate integration.


import requests


api_key = 'your_api_key'
city = 'New York'


response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()


if response.status_code == 200:
    temperature = data['main']['temp']
    print(f'The current temperature in {city} is {temperature} degrees Celsius.')
else:
    print(f'Error: Unable to retrieve data. Status code: {response.status_code}')
