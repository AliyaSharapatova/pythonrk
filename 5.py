A socket is a communication endpoint that allows processes on different machines or within the same machine to communicate with each other. Sockets provide a standard mechanism for processes on different devices to communicate over a network.

Cases:

Client-Server Communication: They are commonly used for communication between a client and a server. For example, a web browser (client) communicates with a web server using sockets.
Peer-to-Peer Communication: They can be used for direct communication between two processes, such as in peer-to-peer applications.
Network Services: Many network services, including web servers, email servers, and chat applications, rely on sockets for communication.

import socket


server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind(('127.0.0.1', 12345))
server_socket.listen(5)

print('Server listening on port 12345...')

while True:
    client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()
    print(f'Got connection from {addr}')

    data = client_socket.recv(1024)
    print(f'Received data: {data.decode()}')

    client_socket.send('Hello, client!'.encode())
    client_socket.close()

client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client_socket.connect(('127.0.0.1', 12345))

message = 'Hello, server!'
client_socket.send(message.encode())

data = client_socket.recv(1024)
print(f'Received from server: {data.decode()}')

client_socket.close()


Limitationss:

Low-Level: They operate at a low level, requiring developers to manage details like data serialization and connection handling.
Platform Dependence: Socket programming can be platform-dependent, and code may need modifications for different operating systems.
Security Concerns: Improperly implemented sockets can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows.
Complexity: Building robust applications with sockets can be complex, especially for large-scale systems.
